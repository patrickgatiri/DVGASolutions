DVGA has an "Import Paste" feature that allows you to load a paste from a URL.
When doing this, DVGA seems to be using a Linux OS command such as curl to retrieve the remote paste.
The URL user input is passed as the argument to the command directly without any sanitization:
	curl <<URL user input>>

We can leverage this misconfiguration to execute system commands on the server.
Using special characters such as ";", "&", "&&", "||",  "|", we can append extra commands.
This will allow us to retrieve information from the server or issue commands directly to the server.

Using the payload "; cat /etc/passwd", we can get detailed information about users on the system.
This payload will be rendered on the server as follows:
	curl; cat /etc/passwd

The payload "; whoami" enables us to know that the web server is running as root:
	curl; whoami
