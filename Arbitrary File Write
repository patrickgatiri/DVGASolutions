DVGA offers an "Upload Paste" feature that allows the user to upload a local file onto the server.
By default, this file is stored in the "pastes/" directory in the root of the web server, under its original file name.
This means that if you upload a file named "file.txt", it will be stored under:
	./pastes/file.txt

The server, however, does not validate or verify the filename.
We can leverage this behaviour to write files to any location on the web server's file system.
Suppose we upload a file with the name "../../../../../tmp/file.txt", this file will be stored under:
	./pastes/../../../../../tmp/file.txt
which is essentially:
	/tmp/file.txt

This vulnerability can also be utilized to overwrite critical files on the server.
Uploading a file with the name "../../../../../etc/passwd" overwrites the /etc/passwd file on the server:
	./pastes/../../../../../etc/passwd	===>	/etc/passwd
