There is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability when creating a new paste. 
Use the following payload as the title or message for your new paste:
	"><img src="x" onerror=alert(1)></img>

You can also achieve stored XSS via the User Agent HTTP header.
Intercept the request sent when creating a new paste, and set the User Agent header to match the payload above.

When uploading/importing a paste, you could upload/import a HTML file that contains the same malicious payload. 
The contents of an uploaded/imported file are rendered directly into the HTML surce, hereby allowing for a stored XSS vulnerability. 
Upload/import the POC file 'stored_xss_upload_paste.html' and watch as the alert box pops up when you view your private pastes.
