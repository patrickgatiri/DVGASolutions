There is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability when creating a new paste. Use the following payload as the title or message for your new paste:
	"><img src="x" onerror=alert(1)></img>

When uploading a paste, you could upload a HTML file that contains the same malicious payload. The contents of an uploaded file are rendered directly into the HTML surce, hereby allowing for a stored XSS vulnerability. Upload the POC file 'stored_xss_upload_paste.html' and watch as the alert box pops up when you view your private pastes.
