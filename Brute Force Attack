DVGA has no rate limiting measures.
As such, there are no restrictions as to the number of requests that can be processed from a single user within a specified time period.
This makes the server vulnerable to brute force attacks.

To provide a POC, I will use the "systemDiagnostics" query.
This query allows the user to issue system commands to the server, provided they provide a valid username and password.
	{
		"query":"query systemDiagnostics { systemDiagnostics (username:\"username\" ,password:\"password\", cmd:\"ls\") }"
	}

Since we are not aware of the credentials, we can bruteforce the username and password fields until we find the correct match.
Using Kalilinux' rockyou.txt wordlist, we find the correct credentials are as follows:
	username : admin
	password : letmein

With the correct credentials obtained, we can successfully authenticate to the server and issue commands directly to the system.
